# Javascript Calculator

This is my take on The Odin Project's Javascript Calculator project. In this project I will build a 
fully functional calculator complete with UI.

## Main Project Objectives

- Create the basic layout of a calculator in HTML with buttons representing number, operators, and others (equals/clear/ect.). [x]
- Link the buttons up to Javascript with event listeners. [x]
- Create functions for the different operators (add, subtract, multiply, and divide to start). [x]
- Create an operate function that will have three parameters (num1, num2, and operator) and call the operator function to do the math. [x]
- Create a populate function that will take the result of the math and push it to the calculator's display. [x]
- Add the option to use floating point numbers. [x]
- Add a 'backspace' button so users can undo if they make a mistake. [x]
- Add keyboard support.
- Style the calculator in CSS to make it look nice.

## Optional Project Objectives

- Add additional operators, such as finding the power of a number, percentages, and +/-.
